# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within route handlers that interact with databases.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks proper error handling for database operations. If the database query fails, the application crashes without providing any informative error message to the client.  This leads to unexpected application behavior and makes debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves using `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during database interactions.  In the event of an error, an appropriate error response is sent back to the client, ensuring graceful error handling.  The solution also demonstrates how to handle various types of errors gracefully.
